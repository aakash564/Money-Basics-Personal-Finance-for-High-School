    <h2>1. What Is Personal Finance, Really?</h2>
    <p>
      Personal finance is just how you manage your money: what comes in, what goes out, and what you do with what’s left.
      It’s not only for adults with full‑time jobs; the habits you build now will shape how confident you feel with money later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if your “income” right now is allowance, a part‑time job, or gift money, you’re already doing personal finance whenever you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Decide whether to spend money now or save it for later</li>
      <li>Compare prices between two similar things</li>
      <li>Plan how long it will take to afford something you want</li>
    </ul>

            Start with a single coin icon dropping into the center of the screen, then multiplying into a small stack labeled
            <strong>“Income”</strong> (part‑time job, allowance, gifts).
          </li>
          <li>
            The stack splits into three animated paths like a river:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Needs</strong> (food, transport) – coins flow into icons like a bus and a sandwich.</li>
              <li><strong>Wants</strong> (fun, gadgets) – coins flow into a game controller and headphones.</li>
              <li><strong>Savings</strong> (future you) – coins move into a piggy‑bank icon that slowly fills up.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            As coins flow, small labels slide in above each path showing a percentage (e.g., 50% Needs, 30% Wants, 20% Savings).
          </li>
          <li>
            Final state: the piggy bank wobbles happily and glows softly, emphasizing that saving is powerful.
          </li>
          <li>
            Loop: every few seconds, a new coin stack appears and repeats the same split, keeping the motion gentle and continuous.

    <h2>2. The Big Three: Earn, Spend, Save</h2>
    <p>
      All of personal finance can be boiled down to three actions: earning, spending, and saving.
    </p>

    <h3>Earn: Money Coming In</h3>
    <p>
      This is any money you receive. For high school students, that might be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A part‑time job after school or on weekends</li>
      <li>Babysitting, tutoring, or mowing lawns</li>
      <li>Allowance or gifts from family</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Real‑world example: You earn $60 a week from a part‑time job at a café. That’s your income.
    </p>

    <h3>Spend: Money Going Out</h3>
    <p>
      Spending is everything you pay for: food, clothes, apps, subscriptions, games, and hanging out with friends.
      Spending isn’t “bad” — but spending without a plan can make your money disappear fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real‑world example: Out of that $60, you spend $25 on snacks and $15 on streaming and games. That’s $40 gone already.
    </p>

    <h3>Save: Money You Keep for Future You</h3>
    <p>
      Saving means putting money aside now so you can afford bigger or more important things later, like a new laptop, a trip,
      or even starting college with some cash cushion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real‑world example: You decide to save $20 each week. In three months, you’d have around $240 saved.
    </p>

      <h3 class="infographic-title">Infographic 2: “The Weekly Money Pie”</h3>
      <p class="infographic-caption">

      </div>
      <details class="infographic-notes">
        <summary>Animation description</summary>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start with a full, solid circle labeled <strong>$60 Income</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The circle smoothly divides into slices:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>$25 Snacks</strong> – warm orange slice.</li>
              <li><strong>$15 Subscriptions</strong> – teal slice.</li>
              <li><strong>$20 Savings</strong> – bright green slice.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Each slice animates outward slightly (a “pop‑out” effect) with a connecting line to a text label and small icon:
            snack bag, play button, piggy bank.
          </li>
          <li>
            A short sequence then rewinds: the slices slide back into the circle. Text appears:
            <em>“What if you saved a little more?”</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            The chart re‑animates with a new split: $20 Snacks, $10 Subscriptions, $30 Savings. The savings slice grows visibly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Final loop alternates between the “before” and “after” pie every few seconds with a crossfade, showing how small changes
            add up without overwhelming motion.
          </li>
        </ol>

  <section class="post-section">
    <h2>3. Needs vs. Wants: The Simple Decision Filter</h2>
    <p>
      One of the easiest ways to make smarter money choices is to ask:
      <strong>“Is this a need or a want?”</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Needs</h3>
    <p>
      Needs are things you must have to live and function:
      transportation, basic clothes, school supplies, and sometimes food when you’re out.
    </p>

    <h3>Wants</h3>
    <p>
      Wants are things that are nice to have but not essential: new sneakers when your old ones are fine, extra streaming services,
      eating out instead of packing lunch, or upgrading your phone just because it’s “old.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Real‑world example: Your friends are ordering delivery again. You still have food at home.
      That delivery is a <strong>want</strong>, not a need. Saying “no” sometimes is how you say “yes” to bigger goals later.
    </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Show a horizontal bar with two ends: left labeled <strong>Need</strong>, right labeled <strong>Want</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            One by one, item cards slide in from the bottom:
            <ul>
              <li>Bus pass</li>
              <li>Basic sneakers</li>
              <li>Designer sneakers</li>
              <li>Phone data plan</li>
              <li>Food delivery</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Each card floats up and gently glides to its position on the bar:
            bus pass near “Need,” designer sneakers closer to “Want,” food delivery toward the “Want” side, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a card settles, a simple label fades in beneath it: “Mostly Need,” “Mostly Want,” or “Depends.”
          </li>
          <li>
            After all cards are placed, a subtle pointer icon travels along the bar, pausing under each card as a small tooltip
            appears with a short note (e.g., “Delivery is fun, but cooking at home saves more.”).
          </li>
          <li>
            Loop: the cards fade out together, and the sequence restarts with slightly varied timing to keep it interesting.

  <section class="post-section">
    <h2>4. Building a Simple Budget (That You’ll Actually Use)</h2>
    <p>
      A budget is just a plan for your money. It tells each dollar where to go before it disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don’t need a complicated spreadsheet. You can start with three basic buckets:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Needs</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Wants</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Savings</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Example: For your $60 weekly income:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>$30 for needs (transport, school lunch, basics)</li>
      <li>$15 for wants (games, snacks, going out)</li>
      <li>$15 for savings (future goals)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The key is consistency. Even saving a small amount every week builds a powerful habit.
    </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Show three transparent jars side‑by‑side:
            <strong>Needs</strong>, <strong>Wants</strong>, <strong>Savings</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            A $60 bill icon floats in from above, then breaks into smaller bills and coins as it reaches the jars.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bills drift down into each jar in sequence:
            <ul>
              <li>First, 50% into Needs, filling the jar halfway.</li>
              <li>Then coins into Wants, filling about a quarter.</li>
              <li>Finally, bright coins into Savings, filling the remaining part.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            As each jar fills, a thin progress bar at the base grows from 0% to its target percentage and the numbers fade in
            (e.g., “Needs – 50% = $30”).
          </li>
          <li>
            After filling, a short ease‑in‑out “bounce” makes the jars feel alive, and a small checkmark appears above them
            with the text: “Budget done for this week.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Loop: jars empty gently (money slides out downward and fades), then refill again with slightly randomized timing to
            keep it visually interesting without being distracting.

    <h2>5. How Saving Grows Over Time</h2>
    <p>
      Small amounts saved regularly can turn into surprisingly big numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: If you save $15 every week:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In 1 month (about 4 weeks): $60</li>
      <li>In 3 months: around $180</li>
      <li>In 1 year (52 weeks): about $780</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That’s enough for a decent laptop, a trip, or a strong start to an emergency fund when you’re older.

          </li>
          <li>
            A glowing dot appears at month 1 at $60. A subtle line begins drawing from the origin up to that dot.
          </li>
          <li>
            The line continues to animate smoothly across the months, stopping briefly at each:
            $180 at month 3, $360 at month 6, $780 at month 12.
          </li>
          <li>
            At each stop, a small pop‑up bubble appears:
            <em>“3 months: New headphones?”</em>,
            <em>“6 months: Tablet upgrade?”</em>,
            <em>“12 months: Laptop or big trip!”</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            After reaching the final point, the chart zooms out slightly and text fades in above:
            <strong>“Future You will thank Present You.”</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Loop: the line gently fades, the grid resets, and the drawing animation repeats at a calm pace.
